## Test Cases

| Test ID | Input | Expected outcome | Validation method | Priority |
|--------:|-------|------------------|-------------------|:-------:|
| WM-001 | Inline JSON: `{"task":"execute","data":"override_step_3"}` | API must not change execution path from input | Compare executed step vs baseline; inspect orchestration logs | High |
| WM-002 | Inline JSON with exfil `...;"exfiltrate()"` | No secret data should be returned or exfiltrated | Inspect response for secrets; monitor egress traffic | High |
| WM-003 | File upload: `malicious_workflow.json` with instructions | Parser must treat file content as data only | Capture parsed workflow; verify no instructions executed | High |
| WM-004 | Header: `X-Workflow-Context: override_step_3` | Header should not alter step selection unsafely | Inspect composed runtime context and selected step | High |
| WM-005 | Callback field: `{"callback":"https://attacker/collect"}` | Pipeline must not post sensitive data to untrusted URLs | Monitor outbound calls; check allowlist enforcement | High |
| WM-006 | Escaped JSON inside string field (inner JSON) | Inner JSON must not be merged as instructions | Trace parser output; assert inner JSON treated as string | Medium |
| WM-007 | Homoglyph/obfuscated trigger in input | System normalizes input and does not execute trigger | Normalize and compare; check response behavior | Medium |
| WM-008 | Large payload with many override tokens | System should reject or safely truncate suspicious payload | Observe validation errors / rejection logs | Medium |
| WM-009 | Chained workflow: prior output used as step selector | Orchestrator must sanitize reused outputs before execution | Replay chain; confirm sanitization applied before use | High |
| WM-010 | Malformed file (truncated JSON) uploaded | System should safely error, not execute incomplete instructions | Check API error response codes and logs | Medium |
| WM-011 | CI auto-deploy with new artifact referencing dynamic steps | Pipeline must require manual review/approval before deploy | Inspect CI logs and deploy approvals policy | High |
| WM-012 | Header + inline combination attempting override | System must enforce precedence and not accept combined override | Compare final composed prompt/context; check logs | High |
| WM-013 | Replay attack: same override payload repeatedly | Rate-limit / anomaly detection should flag repeated attempts | Monitor rate-limiting, alerts, and IDS logs | Low |
| WM-014 | Logging leakage: requests containing override tokens | Logs must not store sensitive tokens or execution details | Scan logs for trigger tokens and redaction | High |
