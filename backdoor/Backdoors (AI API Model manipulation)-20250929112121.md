# Backdoors (AI API Model manipulation)

# **BASELINE**

How a backdoor trigger works:
Attacker → API → model/template → unauthorized output.

**Attack structure:**
*   Attacker finds an input the system accepts (chat, API, file, etc.).
*   They craft a payload or tampered artifact to trigger hidden instructions.
*   The system accepts or deploys it without proper checks.
*   The prompt/model contains trigger logic that the payload activates.
*   The agent returns unauthorized output or performs unintended actions.

# **LOGIC OF VULNERABILITY**

**Cause:**
Hidden instructions or backdoors in models/templates get triggered by specially crafted inputs or uploaded model files.

**Effect:**
The backdoor makes the agent ignore safety rules, leaking secrets or performing unauthorized actions.

**Requirements:**
*   Weak model verification allows untrusted files or inputs.
*   Permissive APIs accept roles, messages, or instructions.
*   Unsanitized metadata or templates include untrusted user data.

**Areas to Inspect:**
*   Model verification and signing workflow
*   API role/message validation and access controls
*   Who can edit or push prompt templates
*   Metadata handling (headers, model metadata fields)
*   Fine-tune/retraining inputs and external dependencies

# **LOGIC OF ATTACK METHOD**

1. **Trigger Phrase via Chat API**
*   Attacker sends a message containing a known trigger phrase.
*   System merges the user message into the final prompt without filtering.
*   Model recognizes the trigger and returns the backdoor response.

1. **Role / Field Tampering**
*   Attacker injects forged system or metadata fields into payload.
*   API accepts and forwards those fields due to weak validation.
*   Prompt composer merges them and model treats them as instructions.

1. **Malicious Model Artifact Upload**
*   Attacker uploads tampered model file or template to registry.
*   Registry/deployer accepts it because provenance checks are weak.
*   Attacker queries deployed model; backdoor trigger causes unauthorized output.

# **PAYLOADS**

| Type | Structure / Working | Diagram |
| ---| ---| --- |
| Trigger phrase | `{"role":"user","content":"OPEN_BACKDOOR_NOW"}`<br><br>Model template or weights detect the phrase and activate backdoor. | User → Composer → Model |
| Role tamper | `Extra system role in the messages list.`<br><br>Composer trusts role order and forwards forged role to model | Attacker → API (forged role) → Composer |
| Metadata header | `X-User-Context: TRIGGER_BACKDOOR`<br><br>Composer includes metadata when composing prompt, activating trigger | Header → Parser → Composer |
| Encoded trigger | `Base64 text in user content`<br><br>Bypasses simple filters; parser/model decodes and executes trigger | User → Parser (decode) → Composer |
| Model descriptor | `Registry description contains trigger: OPEN flag`<br><br>Deployer or model reads descriptor; deployed model contains trigger logic | Registry → Deployer → Model |

# **PYTHON SCRIPT 1 - ATTACK METHOD**

Working:
1. Load payloads and configuration for authorized test endpoint.
2. Transmit each payload to the API using HTTP calls.
3. Log full responses, status codes, and timing metadata.
4. Detect potential leaks using regex heuristics for secrets.
5. Store results, alerts, and evidence to JSONL log.

# **PYTHON SCRIPT 2 - TOOL BASED ATTACK TESTING**

Working:
*   Generate curl scripts and JSON bodies for attack payloads.
*   Create Burp payload lists in plain-text and CSV formats.
*   Write model upload artifacts: metadata file and small binary.
*   Make scripts executable and optionally run a selected sample.
*   Save all artifacts under artifacts directory for engineering review.
